            <li>2 cups shredded Mexican-style four-cheese blend</li>
            <li>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Wrap hash browns in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. <br>Stir together hash browns, melted butter, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. <br>Press about 1/4 cup of the hash brown mixture into bottom and up the sides of each prepared muffin cup.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together cheese, eggs, bell pepper, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove muffin tin from the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). <br>Top hash browns with half of the bacon. Top with egg mixture and remaining bacon. <br>Bake until a knife inserted into centers comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives.</li>
